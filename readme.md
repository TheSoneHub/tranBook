### Technical Stack & Architecture

- **Frontend:** Static Web App (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Core Libraries:**
    - `pdf.js` for PDF rendering
    - `docx-preview.js` for DOCX rendering
    - `Epub.js` for EPUB rendering
    - `Split.js` for resizable panes
- **Local Storage:** IndexedDB for the document library
- **AI Backend:** Google Gemini API
- **API Key Security:** The final version uses a local `config.js` file (ignored by Git) to store the API key, ensuring it is not exposed in public repositories

### Final Decision: Feature Removals for Stability

- Removed **Table of Contents (TOC)** due to instability across document types and UI clutter. Kept the reliable **Go to Page** feature for PDFs to maintain stability and clarity.

### Open Issues

- Fonts
- Zoom in / zoom out
